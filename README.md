Build a simple Cryptocurrency Tracker Web Application using ReactJS and TypeScript. This application should display real-time values of some popular cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.).


As an additional "plus", integrate Web3 to enable interaction with Ethereum blockchain.

Core Requirements:
	• Use ReactJS and TypeScript to create the application.
	• Use a free cryptocurrency API to fetch the real-time data of cryptocurrencies.
	• Display the name, symbol, current price, and daily percentage change of each cryptocurrency.
	• Implement a feature to add cryptocurrencies to a "Favorites" list, stored in the local storage of the browser.
	• The user interface should be clean and user-friendly.
	• Include responsive design to ensure the application is viewable on both desktop and mobile.


 Bonus Requirements:
	• Integrate Web3.js/Ethers.js into your application.
	• Display the current Ethereum balance of a user-entered Ethereum address.
	• Implement a feature to send Ether from one user-entered address to another. You can use a testnet like Goerli for this feature.


 Deliverables:
	• A public GitHub repository containing your code.
	• A ReadMe file that explains:
- your design decisions and why you made them
- how to run your project
- how to use your project (if it's not self-explanatory)
	• A deployed version of your site, use services like Vercel or Netlify for hosting.


 The evaluation will be based on the code quality, application functionality, design, and the bonus Web3 integration.

 The deadline for submission is one week from the date you received this assignment.

Note: This is a technical exercise and will be used solely for evaluation purposes.

 Once you've submitted your work, the following steps will be followed:

1. Submission: Submit the public GitHub repository link containing your code and the URL of the deployed site. Remember to include a comprehensive ReadMe file in your repository.
2. Code Review: Our engineers will review your work within 2 to 5 working days.
3. Feedback: We'll provide feedback on your work and if your solution meets our expectations, we'll proceed to the next step.
4. Interview: A technical interview will be scheduled where you'll discuss your solution and answer some technical questions.
5. Offer: If successful, we'll extend an offer for you to join our team.

We appreciate your time and effort in undertaking this task. If you have any questions or need clarification on any part of the task or the hiring process, feel free to reach out to us. We look forward to seeing your application in action.# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
