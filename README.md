Tech tasks:

Build a simple Cryptocurrency Tracker Web Application using ReactJS and TypeScript. This application should display real-time values of some popular cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.).


As an additional "plus", integrate Web3 to enable interaction with Ethereum blockchain.

Core Requirements:
	• Use ReactJS and TypeScript to create the application.
	• Use a free cryptocurrency API to fetch the real-time data of cryptocurrencies.
	• Display the name, symbol, current price, and daily percentage change of each cryptocurrency.
	• Implement a feature to add cryptocurrencies to a "Favorites" list, stored in the local storage of the browser.
	• The user interface should be clean and user-friendly.
	• Include responsive design to ensure the application is viewable on both desktop and mobile.


 Bonus Requirements:
	• Integrate Web3.js/Ethers.js into your application.
	• Display the current Ethereum balance of a user-entered Ethereum address.
	• Implement a feature to send Ether from one user-entered address to another. You can use a testnet like Goerli for this feature.
