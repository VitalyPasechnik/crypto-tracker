Tech tasks:

Build a simple Cryptocurrency Tracker Web Application using ReactJS and TypeScript. This application should display real-time values of some popular cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.).


As an additional "plus", integrate Web3 to enable interaction with Ethereum blockchain.

Core Requirements:
	• Use ReactJS and TypeScript to create the application.
	• Use a free cryptocurrency API to fetch the real-time data of cryptocurrencies.
	• Display the name, symbol, current price, and daily percentage change of each cryptocurrency.
	• Implement a feature to add cryptocurrencies to a "Favorites" list, stored in the local storage of the browser.
	• The user interface should be clean and user-friendly.
	• Include responsive design to ensure the application is viewable on both desktop and mobile.


 Bonus Requirements:
	• Integrate Web3.js/Ethers.js into your application.
	• Display the current Ethereum balance of a user-entered Ethereum address.
	• Implement a feature to send Ether from one user-entered address to another. You can use a testnet like Goerli for this feature.


 Deliverables:
	• A public GitHub repository containing your code.
	• A ReadMe file that explains:
- your design decisions and why you made them
- how to run your project
- how to use your project (if it's not self-explanatory)
	• A deployed version of your site, use services like Vercel or Netlify for hosting.


 The evaluation will be based on the code quality, application functionality, design, and the bonus Web3 integration.

 The deadline for submission is one week from the date you received this assignment.

Note: This is a technical exercise and will be used solely for evaluation purposes.
